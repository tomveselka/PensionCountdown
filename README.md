# Pension Countdown

Pension Countdown is simple mobile application and my first attempt to make something for Android using Android Studio. I was inspired by my father joking he wanted application where he could see, how long he has until pensions.


## Usage
User first sets up basic information needed for calculating pension age. For men, it is just date of birth, while for women born before 1971, number of raised children can make pension age lower (more raised children, earlier woman can go into pension)

After inputting data and clicking button, info on users pension age and date is displayed

After that, main page displays countdown until that beautiful day
